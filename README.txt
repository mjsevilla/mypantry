Upon opening our app, you will be taken to the home screen...the Pantry List screen. This screen is also the bottom left tab of the app. This screen is a tableview of food item categories that you have input to our app. Upon pressing "Add" in the top right, a sub menu will appear with a text box and "Add Category" button. The user will type the name of their category and press "Add Category" in order to add a category. Categories will be represented by rows with Disclosure Indicators (right arrows) on the right hand side. Categories may be deleted by swiping left.
Upon touching the category, the user will be taken to the list of food items in that category. A food item may be deleted by swiping left as well. In order to add a food item to a category, the user will press the "Scan" tab on the bottom right hand corner. This will bring up a barcode scanner that the user will put up next to a food item. 
Once the item gets scanned, a sub menu will appear with the name of the item, auto-filled by the barcode scanner, and a dropdown menu asking the user which current category the food item fits under. If the user wishes to add a new category, they may do so in this screen by pressing the last row in the drop-down, which will read "Add Category" in blue. 
Finally, if the user wishes to go shopping, the user will press the "Shopping" tab, which is the middle tab. This will be a tableview of categories, with the names of the categories in bold and the respective food item labels appearing underneath their categories. A checkbox will be to the right of each food item, and by default all foods will be unchecked. Upon checking at least one item, the user can then scroll to the bottom of the tableview and click the "Go Shopping" button. This will bring up a tableview of food items that, upon being clicked, appear as crossed off (but not removed) from the tableview.
